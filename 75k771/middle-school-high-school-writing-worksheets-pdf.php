                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Transition Words and Phrases Worksheet for High Schools. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. The next activity is called Transition Words and Phrases. And this activity tasks students with being able to convey the relationship between two separate ideas by using appropriate transition words and phrases, for relationships such as a time relationship, causality, conclusion, comparison, a contrast. And for each relationship, the reference sheet gives students examples of different words and phrases they can use to convey that relationship. So, for example, to show causality, they may need the word “because”, or “therefore”, or “consequently”, right? For contrasting ideas they may be able to use “but” or “however”, or “although”, and students can take the reference sheet back to the classroom with them because it could be helpful for all their writing assignments. After they go over the reference sheet, then they are tasked with a few pages of exercises where they need to look at two different ideas or two different sentences, decide what the relationship is between those two ideas, and then go to their reference sheet and plug in one of the transition words or phrases to connect those two ideas.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">This worksheet focuses on the ability to both comprehend and communicate semantic relationships between ideas.  Understanding how separate ideas are related is pivotal to a greater grasp of the big picture. The three-page <em>Transition Words and Phrases</em> worksheet begins with a reference handout reinforcing students' understanding of conceptual relationships like causality, clarification, comparison, and contrast  while providing example words and phrases expressing these relationships.  It presents a pair of tasks: one, where students are supplied with the conceptual relationship between phrase or sentence pairs and have to combine these ideas using transition words and phrases; and two, where students are asked to identify relationships between idea pairs before providing transition words and phrases for the purpose of combining said ideas.  This material helps develop students' awareness of these relationships and helps them practice expressing them.</p>
