                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Time Sensitivity activity. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. Time Sensitivity is next. I created Time Sensitivity because, and I believe you've seen the same situation where students do not have a concept of time, they talk and talk and talk, and don't realize that you don't have time for them, you're just so busy, you have so many things to get done. And they're not picking up on nonverbal clues. So, for this situation, they're really working on two different skills: they're given a situation and they're given a person to whom they are speaking with in the situation, and first they have to determine the time limit that they have, how many seconds they think they should be talking to that person. And then they have to cover the content within that time limit. I actually did this activity with one of my students this morning, and just to give you examples from the activity, he was tasked with the school principal stops him in the hallway in between classes and asks how his weekend went.</p>
                            <p tabindex="0">And he estimated he should only speak for about 20 seconds, and then we did a little role-play. Sure enough, he did it within 20 seconds exactly, he said just the right amount. Of course, as with all these skills, the important component is generalization: can they go out and do that with everyone? Thanks for viewing my description of my Time Sensitivity activity.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="lead wow animate__fadeInUp">This activity helps strengthen one's understanding of time limits with a conversational partner while teaching how to communicate conversational content succinctly so as to respect these needs.</p>
                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">After a written discussion regarding necessary sensitivity for a listener's availability limits, students use dice to obtain hypothetical content and context: what they are to say, to whom they are speaking, and the situation in which they are conversing.  Once they have taken into account the context, students establish an appropriate time limit and practice delivering their assigned content within that time allotment.  This activity endeavors to improve students' cognizance of listener presupposition and their proficiency in limiting the time utilized to communicate their content so as to fit the aforementioned needs.  This lesson pairs well with the Kinesics and Conversation Skills resource as well as Editing Verbal Narratives, as all three of these materials work on communicating in a way that best fits the needs of conversational partners.</p>
