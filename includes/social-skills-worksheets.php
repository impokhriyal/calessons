                                    <p tabindex="0" class="card-text">'Narratives: Set the Scene' is a highly effective tool I've designed to help individuals with attention deficit disorders, executive functioning impairments, or those on the autism spectrum to share stories in an organized, detailed, and listener-friendly way, as many of these students often struggle to respond to straightforward requests like "tell me about your summer" or "share your internship experience." Given their difficulty in understanding what their listener doesn't already know due to challenges with theory of mind, this tool specifically targets this skill, offering a clear, practical method for students to remember the necessary information to share at the beginning of a verbal narrative and to practice disseminating that information.</p>

We utilize the handout as a checklist during group sessions, marking each proposed topic based on its interest, relatability, and appropriateness, and the topics that are universally approved become our "good topics" for conversation, emphasizing that what constitutes a "good topic" varies depending on the composition of the group.</p>

To encourage reflection and deeper understanding, I often ask students to complete a post-conversation questionnaire that prompts them to consider their conversational partner's perspective, identify the impressions they've given, and analyze non-verbal behaviors, sometimes even briefing them on the questions prior to the conversation so they know what to observe.</p>
