Many language impaired children tend to use non-specific words, such as "upset", to convey emotions. This activity challenges students to replace these non-specific terms with more precise and descriptive words like "disappointed", "sullen", "outraged", or "frustrated". By identifying and replacing underlined non-specific terms in sentences, students enhance their ability to express themselves effectively. This worksheet is suitable for group sessions and encourages students to evaluate the effectiveness of different replacements. An answer key with multiple possible replacements is provided.</p>

The reference sheet provides students with common words and phrases used to denote several different relationships between ideas, including time, comparisons, contrasts, specificity, and causality. For example, “so”, “therefore”, and “because” can be used to indicate a causal relationship. The exercises task students with choosing transition words and phrases to combine phrases or sentences, thus providing practice at writing syntactically complex sentences.</p>
