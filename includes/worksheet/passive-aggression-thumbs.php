It begins with an extensive discussion on helping individuals on the autism spectrum develop perspective taking and empathy, including some of my professional experiences. A homework handout follows, requiring students to observe real-life social interactions and to “put themselves in another's shoes”. The handout ends by asking what actions the student could have taken to improve a social situation for a person in distress, thereby tying observation and interpretation to troubleshooting and taking action.</p>

Students then have the opportunity to enhance their social observation and perspective-taking skills using the session handout, and further generalize their learning by utilizing the "homework" handout for real-world practice.</p>

Many of us encounter individuals in our lives who struggle with monopolizing conversations, interrupting frequently, or sharing lengthy stories with excessive detail. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to address these behaviors comfortably. As a social emotional learning teacher, I value the opportunity to guide my students in developing social niceties and conversation skills. We engage in discussions about each aspect of Being a Good Conversationalist and practice through various exercises, often focusing on one aspect at a time. For further information and guidance, please refer to the therapeutic notes provided. Together, we strive to foster positive and engaging interactions in both personal and professional settings.</p>

Dining out involves social interactions with servers and other staff, requiring perspective taking skills. I emphasize the impact of our behaviors on others, discussing topics like the importance of making reservations, avoiding late arrivals, and practicing politeness. By understanding these social dynamics, students can navigate restaurant settings more effectively.</p>
