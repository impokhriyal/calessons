This activity emphasizes the importance of observation in determining acceptance, as individuals on the spectrum may not naturally observe facial expressions, body language, and interactions as effectively as neurotypical individuals. By engaging in this activity, students gain real-life practice in observing signs of interest versus disinterest, enabling them to make informed decisions about continuing or discontinuing conversations.</p>

                                        <p tabindex="0" class="card-text">Narratives: Set the Scene is a valuable resource for teaching individuals with attention deficit disorders, executive skills impairments, or autism spectrum disorder how to effectively share stories in a well-structured, comprehensive, and engaging manner. Many of my students with these challenges struggle when asked to provide information or share personal experiences. They often omit important details such as the setting, people involved, or time frame, making it difficult for their listeners to follow along. Theory of mind difficulties further complicate their storytelling as they struggle to consider what their listeners may not already know. To address this, I developed Narratives: Set the Scene to specifically target this skill. Through this activity, students learn to consciously include necessary details at the beginning of their narratives and practice delivering information in a clear and coherent way. It has proven to be an effective and practical tool for helping students improve their storytelling abilities and enhance their communication skills.</p>

Many of us encounter individuals in our lives who struggle with monopolizing conversations, interrupting frequently, or sharing lengthy stories with excessive detail. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to address these behaviors comfortably. As a social emotional learning teacher, I value the opportunity to guide my students in developing social niceties and conversation skills. We engage in discussions about each aspect of Being a Good Conversationalist and practice through various exercises, often focusing on one aspect at a time. For further information and guidance, please refer to the therapeutic notes provided. Together, we strive to foster positive and engaging interactions in both personal and professional settings.</p>

I explain that a good topic should meet three criteria: it should be interesting to all participants, have common ground so everyone can contribute, and be appropriate for everyone involved. However, there are exceptions to these guidelines. For instance, storytelling or sharing information may not require common ground. Similarly, topics considered inappropriate, such as sex, politics, or religion, can be discussed with specific individuals like close family members, friends, or counselors. To facilitate this skill, I provide a checklist handout. During group sessions, we individually fill out the handout, marking topics as interesting, familiar, and appropriate for our specific group.</p>

I explain to my students that these skills serve two purposes: extending conversations and making their communication partners feel genuinely heard. To facilitate this practice, I provide various interview forms and offer therapeutic intervention notes for additional guidance.</p>

These conversations occur in both natural and "naturalistic" settings, such as during walks or at the start of our sessions. During our sessions, I target various aspects like topic shifting, turn taking, using a balance of questions and comments, and interpreting non-verbal communication. After some conversations, I find it beneficial to have my students complete this post-conversation questionnaire. The questionnaire prompts them to be curious about their conversational partner, identify the impressions they give, and analyze non-verbal behaviors. To enhance their awareness, some students find it helpful to review the questions before the conversation, allowing them to focus on specific aspects during the interaction. Additionally, I always encourage them to pay close attention to only one person during these conversations.</p>

                                        <p tabindex="0" class="card-text">In social emotional learning, tone of voice is a crucial aspect of non-verbal communication that often gets overlooked. It plays a significant role in expressing and interpreting emotions and intentions. How we say something is just as important as the words we use. This is evident in the misinterpretation of text messages and emails, as humor and tone can be lost. For a hilarious example, check out the YouTube video "Key & Peele: Text Message Confusion" (censored version recommended for students). Teaching individuals on the autism spectrum to understand and effectively use tone of voice can be challenging. To address this, I've created an activity that focuses on interpreting and utilizing tone of voice. Additionally, Tone of Voice can serve as an evaluation tool. At my school, we have encountered situations where students appeared rude or whiny, but through understanding their tone of voice, we gained insight into their true intentions and responded accordingly.</p>

Since they may not naturally pick up on others' behaviors like neurotypical individuals do, this homework helps them develop this crucial skill. Before assigning the task, we engage in various activities to practice interpretation. For instance, we watch videos without sound and identify non-verbal signs of different emotions. We also utilize the Tone of Voice activity to improve their understanding of tone. Additionally, we explore Kinesics: Interest vs. Disinterest to grasp how non-verbal behaviors indicate someone's level of interest. Unlike the "Looking Out for Others' Feelings Homework" in Developing Empathy, which focuses on understanding perspectives through context, the Interpreting Non-Verbal Communication Homework centers on interpreting others' perspectives through non-verbal cues.</p>

I always go first to create a safe environment, and I ensure that no student feels pressured to participate if they're uncomfortable. The form focuses on appearance features within our control, like clothing choices, rather than unchangeable attributes like height or weight. We deliberately avoid reinforcing stereotypes, such as assuming radicalism for women with tattoos or assuming someone's sexual orientation based on jewelry. After completing the form, the person being judged evaluates the accuracy of the impressions, indicating whether they are accurate, somewhat accurate, or inaccurate. This activity aims to debunk stereotypes and highlight the importance of looking beyond appearances to truly understand others.</p>

                                        <p tabindex="0" class="card-text">In my social emotional learning class, I frequently discuss the concept of altruism with my students. I emphasize that being kind to others is not only the right thing to do, but it also brings personal benefits. I explain that acts of kindness create positive impressions, leading to opportunities for friendships, romantic relationships, positive interactions with others, and professional growth. The Impressions and Altruism activity takes this a step further by considering the feelings of others in different situations. Through role-playing, students engage in five social interactions and respond to questions on how they can benefit both themselves and the other person involved. It's important to note that in certain situations, the well-being of the other person may be of lesser importance, such as during a job interview or a medical appointment.</p>

I realized that expecting them to provide insights on something they struggle with wasn't fair. To support their perspective-taking abilities, I created a reference sheet containing common feelings and perceptions during social interactions. This resource has proven beneficial as students can refer to it while engaging in perspective-taking tasks. While initially designed for three specific social situations, the reference sheet serves as a valuable tool whenever students are asked to discuss others' points of view.</p>

To provide real-world learning experiences, I take my students on walks and outings to observe social interactions beyond the classroom. These experiences have revealed important insights, such as students struggling to engage in conversation or understanding how to appropriately get someone's attention. I realized the need to teach this skill when I observed a student attempting to gain a teacher's attention in an ineffective way. To address this, I have my students practice approaching staff members considering various factors like open or closed doors, ongoing conversations, and the context of the situation. I provide a form for them to deliver to staff members and collect feedback on their performance. This process helps me identify specific areas where students may need further support and allows for constructive discussions with receptive students based on staff evaluations.</p>

In our discussions, we explore how our behaviors can impact others, emphasizing the importance of considerations like not arriving close to closing time and practicing politeness. By understanding these social dynamics, students can navigate restaurant settings with confidence and respect for others.</p>

I guide my students in recognizing and effectively managing passive aggressive comments and behaviors because hostility is unfair to them. We begin by discussing the term "passive aggression" and its implications. Through examples like backhanded compliments, such as "You don't look so fat in that top," we explore how aggression is concealed within seemingly harmless remarks. We analyze the underlying hostility and the passive strategies employed. We then focus on strategies for responding to such behavior. I encourage my students to calmly address the hostility, empowering them to assert themselves and discourage further passive aggressive actions. I also emphasize the importance of considering individual circumstances and choosing the best approach for each situation.</p>
