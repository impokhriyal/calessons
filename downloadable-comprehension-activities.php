                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Leisure Time Language Input handout for parents. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. And last is an activity I call Leisure Time Language Input and it's a homework assignment. You know, so often in parent-teacher conferences I've had parents ask me, “what can I have my child do at home to work on building their comprehension?” And I always make sure to say, “well, they don't have to read textbooks or read novels to build their comprehension”, really, it's however they like to take language in, right? I don't call it leisure time reading, leisure time language input, they just need to hear more sophisticated concepts, higher level vocabulary. So, maybe they like to read, they don't necessarily have to read novels, they can read on the Internet, there is some sophisticated discussion going on, on the Internet. So, we go to different sources of interesting discussions, and debates, and editorials, and then also if they don't want to read, they can take in language by watching videos. They can watch documentaries, nature shows, science shows, C-SPAN, intelligent discussion at the dinner table, anything like that. This homework assignment they have to, of their own choosing, pick a source, maybe an article on digg.com or a YouTube video that’s somewhat educational. And they have to then fill out the homework assignment, filling in what they read or what they watched and a few questions about it. I just want them to get used to being exposed to more interesting and intelligent language outside of school. Thanks for reviewing my description of my Leisure Time Language Input handout.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="lead wow animate__fadeInUp">Many students (and parents) believe the best way to improve and expand one’s vocabulary, general knowledge, language comprehension, and reasoning skills outside of school is by reading novels and/or resource books.</p>
                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">However, there are countless other examples of content capable of leading to language improvement, examples young and teenage learners might actually enjoy consuming.  This homework handout requires students to read (or listen or watch) their choice of any number of language content sources and to then draft a brief summary of this content.  A discussion included in the assignment details the “how” and “why” while offering a description of various, effective sources.  The assignment is titled “Leisure Time Language Input” as opposed to “Leisure Time Reading” because consuming language auditorily can also help strengthen one’s language comprehension (and expression) as effectively as consuming it via reading.  For learners with decoding deficits, it can even offer a more effective medium through which to consume language content.</p>
