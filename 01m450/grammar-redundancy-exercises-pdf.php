                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Redundancy worksheet. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. Redundancy comes next and it is a writing skill, but it also involves a lot of comprehension. For Redundancy, students are given sentences and they have to figure out which words in the sentence are redundant, and then omit them. They really have to tease out the comprehension also, because, for example, one of the sentences talks about “Sarah and I were friends from way back in first grade, when we were young”. You don't have to say when we were young because you said first grade, so those two components are redundant but which one are you going to omit. And I've taught my students to omit the one that's less specific. So, in that example you would omit “when we were young”, doesn't really tell you when, just kind of young, and first grade is much more specific. So, they really have to tease out the meanings and choose the meaning that gives more information. Thanks for viewing my description of my Redundancy worksheet.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">This worksheet (complete with an answer key) involves a number of tasks vital to avoid redundancy.  After a brief written discussion on the topic, students are asked to find redundant elements within a series of provided sentences.  They first learn to break down sentences and analyze meaning therein before identifying redundant components in each and choosing which to remove or keep.  They must also keep an eye out for obvious or self-evident information that should be removed.  As such, this material works on writing skills like avoiding redundancy, while also working on language skills like semantic breakdowns of sentences.</p>
