                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Developing Empathy activity. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. Next comes Developing Empathy. This is a long worksheet that really goes over with students a lot about perspective taking and thinking about other people, noticing other people's moods, noticing things that can go wrong in conversations and make people feel bad. And we go over all the different terms “special inclusion”, “mood”. Once we go over all the terms and the discussion together, we have a short conversation, and before the conversation each student gets one of the forms to fill out, where they are assigned one other person to pay attention to during the conversation. And then we will have a short conversation where I will actually do things that are kind of annoying to the other students, like I might interrupt them, or I might cut them off and say, “oh that's nothing”. I'll do  like little insults. By the way, of course I only do this with students that I have a very good rapport with, and I tell them ahead of time that I'm going to be doing these annoying behaviors. And then after the conversation, I want each student to go over their form, right? They filled out the form on the person that they were supposed to observe: how do you think that person felt, was that person spatially included in the conversation, did that person have a chance to participate in the conversation, did anything happen that might've given that person some negative feelings? And it really zeroes in on thinking about the other person, watching them, and thinking about how they're feeling. Thanks for viewing my description of my Developing Empathy activity.
