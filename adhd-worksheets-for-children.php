                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome  to my social skills activity Narratives: Set the Scene. Check  out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. Then we come to Narratives: Set  the Scene. I created this activity which works on starting narratives off by giving your listeners needed orienting details, because I found a real need for this skill and I'm sure you see this as well. So often our students start to tell us a story about something that happened over the weekend or about what they did on a trip or any event in school, outside of school, and they often will kind of go right into the story without orienting details, “wait, where are you? Wait, who are you with? What's happening?”. So, for this activity it makes it more tangible, which details they have to start off the story with, and we practice just starting narratives, starting stories, and it also makes it tangible because it's a checklist of did you include who's in it, who's in the event? What's happening? Where's it taking place? And then we move on from that and we work on generalizing that beginning of their narratives into their everyday conversations. Thanks for reviewing my description of this social skills activity.  If you like what you've seen here, please  click and subscribe to my channel. I'm not exactly sure what that means but my web guy told me it's a thing!</p>

                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">Many students with attention deficit disorders, on the autism spectrum, or with executive skill deficits struggle to respond to simple information requests, such as questions about their summer or internship experiences.  Typically, they struggle to provide contextual information (when, where, who, etc.) when starting verbal narratives.  Individuals grappling with Theory of Mind also often find it difficult to put themselves in the shoes of others, so they regularly struggle to understand that their listener is not privy to all of the information they, as the speaker, already know.  They struggle to keep in mind that their listener needs to know this orienting information to adequately understand and appreciate the story.  The Narratives: Set the Scene activity offers an effective, yet simple way for students to identify and practice delivering the information they need to provide at the outset of their narratives.</p>
