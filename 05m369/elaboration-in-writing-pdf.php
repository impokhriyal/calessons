                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my activity Adding Meaning: Simplify and Elaborate. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. The next activity is called Adding Meaning: Simplify and Elaborate. And this activity really gets students to think about the meaning of the sentences, and to realize that more words don't always equal more meaning. It starts off with an example I'm going to read to you: “I ventured outside accompanied by my canine companion to arrive at a public designated area of shrubbery and foliage”. What does that mean? I took my dog to the park, that's all the meaning that's in there. I then show my students a sentence the same length as the first one, but packed with meaning: “I strolled to the giant park at the end of my block with my faithful golden retriever on a snowy winter morning”. OK, packed with meaning. So, for this task students have to simplify these crazy long sentences down to the core meaning, and then they roll a die to find out what they're going to add, how they're going to elaborate, are they going to add an adjective or an adverb, or are they going to take a more general verb like “walk” and replace it with a more specific verb like “strolled” or “tiptoed” or “marched”. So, I really like this activity, the students enjoy it, and I find it really gets down to their ability to understand the core meaning in sentences. Thanks for viewing my description of this activity. If you like what you've seen here, please click and subscribe to my channel. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but my web guy told me it's a thing!</p>

Beginning with an unnecessarily long and detailed example sentence, this activity points out the underlying and more concise meaning.  The subsequent example is a similar sentence but containing more meaning and more specific descriptions of the elements of the sentence.  For the exercise, students are asked to simplify other long, amusingly convoluted sentences before rolling dice to determine which parts of speech (including adjectives, adverbs, more descriptive verbs, more specific nouns, places, and times) they need to add to their now-simplified sentences.</p>
