                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Adjectives and Adverbs worksheets. Check out this excerpt  from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. Next is Descriptive Writing: Adjectives and Adverbs Worksheet. Of course, our students really need to work on the descriptiveness of the writing, and adjectives and adverbs are one of the best ways to do that. I have found that a lot of my students are familiar with adjectives, less familiar with adverbs. So, the four-page worksheet really familiarizes them and gets them more used to using those descriptive words in their writing. Thanks for viewing my description of my Adjectives and Adverbs worksheets. If you like what you've seen here, please click and subscribe to my channel.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">Descriptiveness is pivotal to strong writing, but it is unfortunately not a skill easily achieved by a high percentage of language-impaired learners.  This four-page worksheet starts with a discussion of descriptive writing and adjective use, following with an activity asking students to embed provided adjectives into a variety of sentences.  It subsequently discusses adverb usage and provides examples and tasks involving the usage of various kinds of adverbs, as well as the flexibility of placement within a similar variety of sentences.  The comprehensive nature of the explanations, examples, and subsequent activities offers students adequate practice to help drastically improve the descriptiveness of their writing.</p>
