                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Identifying Main Idea activity. Check out this excerpt from the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. So, now let's talk about identifying your student's learning needs Right? Because teachers, speech therapists a lot of professionals do a lot of talking So, what's the best way for our students to take in all that information we're giving them? What's their learning style? Are they a visual learner? Of course, as time has gone by, people now feel like we're all a mix of different learning styles, it's not like you're just visual or just auditory, but people definitely do have preferences. I, myself, am a very visual person. In fact, when I go to conferences, I have to sit in the front row, because if I can't see the presenter's face, I can barely understand what they're saying. So, kids that are very visual, you might want to put them in the front of the class or give them lots of visuals to help with their comprehension. Kids that are auditory, make sure they have books on tape to read so they can take in information that way. Kids who are kinesthetic learners, it helps them learn if they can hold things in their hands or manipulate. Those students probably really enjoy science lab. And also, what are their referred atmospheres for taking an information or for studying. You know, my whole life, I thought that for everyone the best way to study was in a quiet room sitting up, but since I've worked at Summit I discovered that a lot of people, a lot of our students actually can study better when they're listening to music, it just depends.</p>
                            <p tabindex="0">I also have to think about attention deficits, whether they're internally distracted or externally distracted, I have in my office a lot of fidgets a lot of manipulatives right that helps them focus. Some of my students like to doodle I told him my rule, if it helps you focus you're allowed to doodle, if it's distracting, you're not, because it depends on the person. Also with attention deficit so maybe they need a break here and there, maybe they need timed exertion because a lot of times students with attention deficit disorders have difficulty with the passage of time, so sometimes it helps them if they can exert for X amount of time so it doesn't feel like forever. Or if you've ever used a time timer, did I say that right timed timer, it's a visual timer so as the time goes by, like let's say 15 minutes you'll see, like a quarter of an hour read, and as the time decreases the read the visual decreases. I also like to know what my student's interests are, because if I give them material to work on that's within their areas of interest that's going to be a lot more motivating for them. thanks for viewing my description of my Identifying Main Idea activity.

Because the article covers the author's relationship with their friend, students are thus able to identify with the content, therefore more effectively understanding the messages therein.  By discussing the options afterward, students can better understand how the general option, while true, is not nearly specific enough to adequately communicate the intended message; how the overly specific option includes unnecessary details that cloud the conveyance of the message; and how the “just right” option clearly and concisely communicates the main idea.</p>
