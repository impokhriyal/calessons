                            <p tabindex="0">Welcome to my Perspective Consistency activity. Check out this excerpt from  the training video I did for the New York City Department of Education. After that comes perspective consistency. A very common problem that a lot of my students have is switching perspectives, right, when they're talking or when they're writing an essay. Because you could talk about “they” and “them”, or “we” and “us”, or “you”, and very often students will switch perspectives right in the middle of their essay. For this activity they're given an essay already written, that constantly switches perspectives, and the students need to start with whatever perspective they want to use, and then go through the essay, and make a lot of changes, so that they stick to their one chosen perspective. What I like to do with my students with this one after they've done it written, I'll have them choose a second perspective, right, maybe the first time they chose the “you” perspective, now they're talking to “us”, “we”, and I'll have them just read the essay verbally and make the changes as they go along. A little more difficult but usually after they've done it the first time in writing they're ready to do it orally. Thanks for reviewing my description of my Perspective Consistency activity.

                                <p tabindex="0" class="wow animate__fadeInUp">Perspective inconsistency is one of the most common grammatical mistakes made in writing, especially in persuasive essays; this worksheet aims to make this mistake less common.  This two-page worksheet directly focuses on perspective and pronoun consistency, requiring learners to select a single perspective and maintain this perspective throughout the modification of an example essay.  Once students have made modifications in writing, choosing a second perspective and changing nouns, pronouns, and verbs while reading the essay out loud is an effective way to provide more practice.</p>
